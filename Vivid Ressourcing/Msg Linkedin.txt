I’m reaching out regarding the Mechanical Design Engineer position in Charleroi. I recently graduated as a Mechanical Engineer and believe my background could be a great fit for this role.

During my studies, I worked on numerous academic projects, including a collaboration with Aerospacelab, an aerospace company. These experiences gave me hands-on expertise in 3D modeling, simulation, dimensioning, prototyping, and testing, as well as exposure to advanced manufacturing technologies. While I haven’t yet used CATIA or Siemens NX specifically, I am confident I can adapt quickly, as the principles of 3D modeling and design are the same. Studying in an English-language Master’s program, I also collaborated with students from diverse cultural and national backgrounds, which strengthened my teamwork and communication skills.

I’m very interested in this role because aerospace is such a dynamic and high-tech field. That's why, if my profile matches what you are looking for, I would be happy to speak with you and learn more about the team and projects. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.
